## First Impressions: The Good and The Not-So-Good

I like the coldness and the lightfulness of the surroundings of the Jmingr ut surroundings. I really like being in the nature there and the quality of bike infrastructure that they have created. It's very well signed. I mean, it's very easy to navigate because of the signing down along the route. Every bike line is separated by the bike line and it's going through the nature, or at least it's separated from the asphalt roads. The asphalt roads are anyway the secondary or tertiary communication roads, so it's very calm.

However, what I didn't like about the route was the end, specifically the last 12-15 kilometers. The separated bike line was placed alongside a very busy sub-urban road. It was quite occupied by cars, noisy, and rather polluted.

## The Journey: From Vrospaf to Jmingr ut and Beyond

I left Vrospaf from the main railway station, and it took about 26 minutes to get to Jmingr ut. Upon arrival, you are greeted with really nice bike lines and some mixed local roads within Jmingr ut. It's very easy and effortless to get from the railway station in Jmingr ut onto the proper bike lines in nature.

### Towards Milic: Nature's Embrace

Then I took a route from Jmingr ut in the direction of Milic. I was totally surprised by the beautifulness of the surroundings. The landscape was just perfect. You are surrounded by a riverbank and some really nice greenery. You can meet a lot of different kinds of birds flying around you, trying to figure out what the fuck you are doing here.

### Proshitsa and the Blooming Fields

Next, I took a right into Proshitsa city, which was very nice. Again, a separated bike line ran along the fields. It's June now, so the fields were blooming with crops and flowers, obviously. It was really colorful and intense, both for the eyes and for the nose, but in a good way.

### The Challenge: Proshitsa to Borneke

From Proshitsa, I think the part leading to Borneke could be quite challenging for average bike riders. The ascent is really long, I would say. It's not a hardcore one – I wasn't exhausted after it, as it's just 200 meters of ascent in the end – but for average bike riders, it could be quite challenging. I would suggest taking a break. However, it really pays off. After that, you have a delightful, extremely engaging downhill ride into Bornekeszlandské.

### Descent to Brotswa and Gravel Adventures

Then from Bornekeszlandské, you have a delicate downhill, a delicate descent towards Brotswa, mixed with some gravel routes, which makes it really, really perfect.

### The Final Stretch: A Tale of Two Worlds

As I mentioned, the last part of the route is a mix of bike lines alongside a very busy road connecting the city center with the suburbs. The greenery is there, obviously, but as I said, it's quite noisy.

Comparing the end of the route with the beginning, they are two different worlds. The first world is about calmness, nature, and chill, and the second one is about traffic and busyness.
