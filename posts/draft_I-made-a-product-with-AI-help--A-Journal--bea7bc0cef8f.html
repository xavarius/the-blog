<section name="5d27" class="section section--body section--first section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="35a9" id="35a9" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">ThI figured how to help myself and my wife with groceries done regularly for our household. I got extremally exited, sat and started coding. Did some research with chatgpt at first, then was jumping between chatgpt windsurf chrome for 3h straight. </p><p name="90bb" id="90bb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The second day</p><p name="9c3f" id="9c3f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s saturday. I’m playing with kids and doing household chores but I am manacally thinking about stuff that I want to do, how much I would eventually earn (that’s totally day dreaming) and how much happy I will be when it’s done. On the other hand I’m scoping down the mvp — I want to make this product work for my family and observe it for some time — before the (beta) market release.</p><p name="e71d" id="e71d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The third day since starting</p><p name="dce8" id="dce8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Windsurf<br>I did a bit of high level code review of the codebase provided by Windsurf. I had to ask it to analyse dead code occurences — it went via all files and then proposed couple of eslint commands to check for warnings, loose ends, not used method and dependencies. That’s quite all right. The codebase is a bit cleaner now.</p><p name="75ba" id="75ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Although, the codebase is still bloated with unnecessary things which mean — I takes more time to validate what AI is delivering — but I won’t give up. </p><p name="72bb" id="72bb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I started thinking about “refactoring”. My initial idea is to learn AI based refactoring (if this is possible) file by file. This is not optimal — but let’s try. I also want to, as a baseline, to do UI testing — I need to be able to verify funcitonality of the system quicku — I need a feedback loop — AI is to random to depend on its results — and more and more complex the system will become — then AI will fail more (like human?). Yeah, let’s see. </p><p name="8d58" id="8d58" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m also consantly working on removing complexity from the system — as above — I feel like senior sofgtware engineer — I’m removing code all the time instead of writting it! xD </p><p name="b1a5" id="b1a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I also see how much additional stuff without asking me Windsurf generates. That’s good since it’s in example implement target price component everywhere it makes sense, on the other hand sometimes it’s a total redudancy/overhead. Interesting. Let’s try to coach it to ask questions before implementation (like humans? :D ).</p><p name="72e6" id="72e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is funny. </p><p name="3836" id="3836" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ok, now. It’s stuck for the third time with “refactor” </p><figure name="f8b7" id="f8b7" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*ymgR4aFlIyd2IOgDq0DeyQ.png" data-width="498" data-height="1016" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ymgR4aFlIyd2IOgDq0DeyQ.png"></figure><p name="4ada" id="4ada" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Maciej out! I need to code now!</p><p name="934e" id="934e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Day 4 since started</p><p name="67c7" id="67c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m a bit confused what I want to achive, even thou I know what I want to achive! I started writting down ideas.md and instructed Windsurf to store my ideas it. It went rogue a bit, and started documenting everything. </p><p name="e0fc" id="e0fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I deleted this file and started my own. Being able to create my own notes (refer to my article here) is super precious since I can rething my thinking instead of trying to follow AI which randomly does stuff. </p><p name="3ae1" id="3ae1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I also just understood that Windsurf setup up my product on the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">deprecated </strong>open source project from Meta</p><div name="19e0" id="19e0" class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--p"><a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app?tab=readme-ov-file" data-href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app?tab=readme-ov-file" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app?tab=readme-ov-file"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">GitHub - facebook/create-react-app: Set up a modern web app by running one command.</strong><br><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">Set up a modern web app by running one command.

I need to make a step back and to understand the setup in the details. It may be my engineer soul — but I do not feel confident not understanding decisions made by AI — especially I have found the software used is sometimes deprecated. </p><p name="d91a" id="d91a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Fifth day</p><p name="bbff" id="bbff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I figured I’m somehow not effective anymore. I’m thinking about Price Checker product all the time but I’m not getting things done.</p><p name="d589" id="d589" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I started again, from researching tech stack and ideas with ChatGpt. Since Windsurf started my project on a deprecated template and I was able to remove much of the code created by AI — and app is still running I figured I need to do couple of things, which are:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="222c" id="222c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"> Analyse the idea of the app</li><li name="9a80" id="9a80" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Create a fundational yet mininal tech stack for this app</li><li name="b9ab" id="b9ab" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Instruct Windsurf stricly around software engineering practices, including software architecure, usage of linters, unit testing, automation testing and usage of version control</li><li name="5dd9" id="5dd9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">I need to more in the loop and enforce good engineering practises — in example I will create tests per each step with AI — seems like AI is breaking stuff all the time and I need to keep the changes as minimal as possible and as precise as possible. I can’t keep a snapshot of a project in mind — but I can define specification vs verification rules- TEST! In this case, as in any other software project, I will minimalise regressions.</li></ul><p name="a5c8" id="a5c8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">So, I made a migration from clean React into Next.js approach.</p><p name="2829" id="2829" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What’s interesting the UI basics stayed BUT the presentation changed a lot. New features emerged, like About section and Github cta. I don’t like this — AI changed more then I anticipated and I lost control over changes. Also, it copy pasted a lot of dirs and files from the old project. The remedy was simple — I asked AI to go via project and define which dirs and files are really used. </p><p name="a5c1" id="a5c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The migration is done. </p><p name="a4e5" id="a4e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I still lack a partnership. So I started teaching AI to do basic stuff. I have created .windsurf file which teaches AI guidelines. I provided basic TS guidelines (removed one about JSDocs) and also provided guidelines around making commits to Git. I like the response and how AI works with git. I asked it also to start its messages with “[AI]” tag — this way I will be able to differenciate between my commits (yes, I still do code this app) and AI commits. I also will be able to create metrics around the code, AI vs me. </p><figure name="54c2" id="54c2" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*nen6GKDi9l6tpOhJFAldhw.png" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*nen6GKDi9l6tpOhJFAldhw.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">The “old” app in bare React</figcaption></figure><figure name="d226" id="d226" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--figure"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*i5NM97bRQ_tVLmYsdmi9SA.png" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*i5NM97bRQ_tVLmYsdmi9SA.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">The new app in Next.js</figcaption></figure><p name="13ff" id="13ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">For now I have defined the following steps for myself:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="99b4" id="99b4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">App tour with AI</li><li name="a8f3" id="a8f3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Ensure project files and dependencies are up to date — including removing obsolete stuff</li><li name="91b0" id="91b0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Create lin</li><li name="1f36" id="1f36" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">ter workflow — es lint</li><li name="23ae" id="23ae" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Create a workflow with AI (windsurf rules + memory + examples?) to create TDD flow (or at least to implement unit tests per given code)</li><li name="8f44" id="8f44" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Fix Next.js warning and errors</li><li name="8296" id="8296" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Let’s remove features AI created and which are not needed (github, about, category field). </li><li name="f31b" id="f31b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Finally, test if AI can code, commit and test in one go. I will manually verify the app, for now. </li></ol><p name="a11e" id="a11e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">It’s 4pm, summary time</p><ul class="postList"><li name="9efb" id="9efb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">migrated from bare react to next.js</li><li name="172d" id="172d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Created workflow for the AI to analyse, code, eslint+prettier, run unit tests and then commit code imitating my style of coding</li><li name="7eb6" id="7eb6" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">While doing the above I can clearly see AI uses “old” frameworks and libs by default, I suppose it’s because more examples are there. So, after the initial setup AI and I had to update almost everything again, from Next.js 14 into 16, to EsLint configuration etc. Shame.</li><li name="e2bd" id="e2bd" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Inherited unwanted features which I will have to delete tomorrow</li></ul><p name="58d6" id="58d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Day 6th</p><p name="406c" id="406c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I started fom manual migration of Eslint since Claude 3.7 wasn’t able to deliver it. Then I had to manually install dependencies.</p><p name="deeb" id="deeb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">npm install <a href="http://twitter.com/eslint/compat" data-href="http://twitter.com/eslint/compat" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" title="Twitter profile for @eslint/compat" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@eslint/compat</a> globals <a href="http://twitter.com/eslint/js" data-href="http://twitter.com/eslint/js" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" title="Twitter profile for @eslint/js" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@eslint/js</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/eslint/eslintrc" data-href="http://twitter.com/eslint/eslintrc" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" title="Twitter profile for @eslint/eslintrc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@eslint/eslintrc</a> -D</p><p name="9595" id="9595" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I also failed with instructing Windsurft to do the standard engineering workflow: analyse, code, linter, tests, commit. It wasn’t able to connect the dots and use appropriate commands with appripriate data.</p><p name="0609" id="0609" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I figured, since at least lint, test, commit flow is deterministic I will instruct Windsurf to create a script which does the above. The script accepts a commit message (string) as an input, then runs linter (with — fix option) and prints summary. Then runs tests and prints summary. Then adds all files to staging and commits them with nice looking commit message.</p><p name="6b92" id="6b92" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, I forced Windsurf to do work autonymously. I request feature, it codes, verifies, fixes and commits. Perfect! </p><p name="fa8f" id="fa8f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I kind of feel I know how to work with AI now. The current AI. It will change. That feels good. I can focus on the product now — since the setup looks good enough. As software engineer I wanna a stable tech stack (since I know how much it’s important when scaling the solution i.ex.) but I also wanna to focus on the business core features. I feel I can now. This feels very, very good. </p><p name="117b" id="117b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I also thought I want to see insights around development with AI on a daily basis. I want to track impact of AI vs myself. And I really want to understand what’s the code complexity degree in the project, and how it changes.</p><p name="7779" id="7779" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I made a script with Windsurf to print some of the insights.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetRow" data-paragraph-count="2"><figure name="6117" id="6117" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRow is-partialWidth graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*Oplt3SaSzHcFxsHGz0gQtw.png" data-width="543" data-height="367" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*Oplt3SaSzHcFxsHGz0gQtw.png"></figure><figure name="64a5" id="64a5" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRowContinue is-partialWidth graf-after--figure"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*mWoYeS2m8ULU7e6v-2nvcA.png" data-width="494" data-height="175" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*mWoYeS2m8ULU7e6v-2nvcA.png"></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="556b" id="556b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I need to work on the code complexity metric, thou. </p><p name="e71b" id="e71b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I dropped the code complexity topic. I might not be relatable in the age of AI. Anyway, I have each and every git commit annotated with AI or human contribution indicator — meaning, I can create insights retrospectively anytime I want. That’s powerfull. </p><p name="4f3f" id="4f3f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the other hand, I’m again distracted from the core business logic with fancy shawncy scrippting around cool topics. </p><p name="fdc2" id="fdc2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Creating every toy in the developer toolbox I dreamt about seems so easy -but in the end I’m not doing the CORE work. That’s a trap. That is tricky. </p><p name="3999" id="3999" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Seventh Day</p><p name="6eeb" id="6eeb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I started to think that code complexity matters. Ok, we’re in the age of AI — but there is no outcome without strict human supervision. This means code complexity matters since a person have to oversight, read and maintane a codebase. I need to incorporate this metric into my day to day insights. </p><p name="18b2" id="18b2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I must say that AI is holding me back with new features. Sure, I could instruct it to create code and voila! It’s done. Kinda. Or not done. But I want to be sure that AI can create a deterministic outcomes according to ruleset I created in the long term. And this is a tricky part. I spend a lot of time tutoring AI how to work. It also constantly trying to incorporate deprecated tools, mechanisms, libs and so on. It is so annoying! </p><p name="8f49" id="8f49" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I see that Windsurf starts to act wierd with things it was able to do, like committing with the usage of the script we build together. I asked to validate “the Windsurf memory” and remove redundant and overlapping memory entries — with must have step to confirm all changes with me — to ensure those rules have sense. </p><p name="b456" id="b456" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The 12th day</p><p name="50fe" id="50fe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Windsurf chat broke. I had to start a new one. The old one wasn’t able to execute any command anymore. Thankfully, cascade memory stayed and I had windsurf rules defined per project. </p><p name="3cc4" id="3cc4" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
