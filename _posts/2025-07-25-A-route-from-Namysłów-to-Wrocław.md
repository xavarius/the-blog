#### What I liked about this route

This trip was a mix of everything. Mix of pavements, mix of landscapes. From Namysłów and Bierutów, to Wrocław parks. From cycling paths circling fields to gravel rides. A mostly balanced, soft, refreshing ride.

#### What I didn't like

Again, approaching the finish line meant traffic jams, noise and pollution. The worst part would be Wrocławska street, between Nadolice Wielkie and Dobrzykowice. The magical calmness I felt - vanished in seconds. I see an option to bypass highly occupied car lanes.

#### How to get to Namysłów

I got to Namysłów from Wrocław's Nadodrze Railway station. The ride took around one hour. Then, you need to carry your bike through the pedestrian bridge above the train lines. There is no alternative.

#### Namysłów to Bierutów
Namysłów is a lovely, but not very original city. I'm glad I visited, but I do not recall anything special, I have not caught any special feelings there.
The path from Namysłów to Bierutów is usually a separated bike lane, with few obstacles along the way. A decent ride experience.

####  Młokicie to Bierutów
This part is awesome. I took a route via fields. The perfect experience. The yellow crops. The middle of the summer vibe while watching nearby forests. Perfect companion.

### Bierutów

Take a break here. It's a small city, full of historical sites mixed with poor and chaotic architectural and urban planning choices. 
But it has a huge Hert bakery equipped with coffee, sandwiches and pastries. And a decent grocery store - resupply water there - because for the next 25 kilometers you won't find any shops.

#### Bierutów to Chrząstawa

Oh, that was a ride. The perfect, countryside asphalt ride mixed with soft gravel rides deep in a woods. See pictures. Long kilometers without any living soul.

#### Chrząstawa
Take a break in Widawa Brewery. Worth it. The food is worth it.
If you have spare time, Chrząstawa offers open air swimming opportunity.

#### Chrząstawa to Wrocław
Oh, that was frustrating. As said earlier, the busyness of the road killed the charm.

#### But then Wrocław

I know every inch of the final part of this ride. I rode it billions of times. Odra's and Widawa's riverbanks, parks and forests. I'm in love with the quite overlooked Odra embankment between two districts named Bartoszowice and Kowale (the embankment itself is between a river and city channel which makes it even more extraordinary). Old oaks have been placed on both sides of the embankment. Oh, such a cutie.
