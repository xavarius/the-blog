title: "My Medium Partner Program Experiment: A Look at Earnings"
date: 2025-05-30

For a period, I experimented with Medium.com's Partner Program, placing some of my articles behind their paywall. It was an interesting venture into monetizing blog content directly through the platform. The earnings weren't astronomical, and I wasn't even trying to optimize for it. I learned one thing. There too much paid content on the internet. I can't justify making money from my blog posts. Let's share knowledge for free. 

Here's a quick rundown of which posts generated some earnings during that time:

*   How to start writing reusable components for Android apps? - $37
*   Be effective with Bitrise CI for Android—lessons I learned the hard way. - $8
*   You shouldn’t take AWS Pearson Vue Online Proctoring, if you can, and here is why - $8
*   Android 15 enhanced App Links is an opportunity to give a user an excellent experience - $0.20
*   App Links: Associating Multiple Android App Build Types with a Single Domain - $0.20
*   Mobile DevOps Blueprint: Jumpstart into Android UI testing workflow on Bitrise CI - $0.20
*   Take your fucking notes in the era of AI. - $0.20
*   How do I feel like an ADHD-powered Software Engineer? - $0.10

So, dear readers, that's for that couple cups of good coffee. :coffee:
