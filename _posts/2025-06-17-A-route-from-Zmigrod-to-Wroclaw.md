## A Route from Żmigród to Wrocław

#### What I liked about this route

I loved the wildness of the surroundings of Żmigród. The effortless of hopping onto the route, it's extermally easy to navigate without maps or apps. The first part is immersed in nature, or at least it's separated from (calm) asphalt roads.

#### What I didn't like

However, what I didn't like about the route was the finish. The last 12-15 kilometers. 
The separated bike line was placed alongside a very busy sub-urban road. It was quite occupied by cars, noisy, and rather polluted.

#### How to get to Żmigród

I got to Żmigród from Wrocław from the Main Railway station, it took Intercity train about 25 minutes to get there. Upon arrival, you are greeted with really nice bike lines, mixed with some local roads within Żmigród. It's effortless to get from the railway station in Żmigród onto the trail.

#### Towards Milicz

Then I took a route from Żmigród in the direction of Milicz. I was totally surprised by the beautifulness of the surroundings. The landscape was just perfect. You are surrounded by a riverbank, fields, and a lot of birds flying around you, trying to figure out what the heck you are doing here.

#### Prusice

Next, I took a right into Prusice city. The city itself is one the lowest average monthly income per habitant in Poland. 
I was supprised by niceness of the main square. Again, a separated bike line ran along the fields. 
For a few kilometers I had to share space with cars. 
It's June when I'm writing this, so the fields were blooming with crops and flowers. 
It was really colorful and intense experience, both for the eyes and for the nose, but in a good way.

#### The Challenge: Prusice to Oborniki Śląskie

I think the part leading to Oborniki Śląskie could be quite challenging for average bikers. The ascent is really long, I would say. It's not a hardcore one – I wasn't exhausted after it, as it's just 200 meters of ascent in the end – but for average biker could be challened with it. 
I would suggest taking a break in Oborniki Śląskie. Check out DeguStacja restaurant, vegan options are available.

However, it really pays off. After that, you have a delightful, extremely engaging downhill ride into Oborniki Śląskie.

#### Descent to Wrocław

Then from Oborniki Śląskie, you have a delicate downhill, a delicate descent towards Wrocław, mixed with some gravel routes, which makes it really, really perfect.

#### The Finish Line

As I mentioned, the last part of the route is a mix of bike lines, pedestrian paths and crosswalks alongside a very busy road connecting the city center with the suburbs. The greenery is there, obviously, but as I said, it's quite noisy.

Comparing the end of the route with the beginning, they are two different worlds. The first world is about calmness, nature, and chill, and the second one is about traffic and busyness.
