#### What I liked about this route

I loved the wilderness. The effortless way of hopping onto the route. And its extermally easy to navigate paths, even without maps or apps. The first part is immersed in nature, or at least it is separated from (calm) asphalt roads.

#### What I didn't like

However, what I didn't like about the route was the finish. The last 12-15 kilometers. I know them well.
A separated bike line in Wrocław was placed alongside a very busy sub-urban road. It was quite occupied by cars, noisy, and rather polluted.

#### How to get to Żmigród

I got to Żmigród from Wrocław from the Main Railway station. The ride with an Intercity train took about 25 minutes. Upon arrival, you are greeted with really nice bike lines, mixed with some local roads. It's effortless to get from the railway station in Żmigród onto the trail.

#### Towards Milicz

Then I took a red train starting near [the Palace](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GcxTXHv6tTAk4D5g7). I was totally surprised by the beautifulness of the surroundings. The landscape was perfect. You are surrounded by a riverbank, fields, and a lot of birds flying around you, trying to figure out what the heck are you doing here. Perfection.

#### Prusice

It's June when I'm writing this, so the fields were blooming with crops and flowers. 
It was really colorful and intense experience, both for the eyes and for the nose, but in a good way.
Next, I took a right turn leading to town Prusice. The city is one of the lowest average monthly income cities per habitant in Poland. 
I was supprised how nice the main square was. Not supprising to someone who visited cities around Wrocław, but still nice one.

#### Prusice to Oborniki Śląskie

That's the part where I had to share space with cars for a couple of kilometers.
I think the part leading to Oborniki Śląskie could be quite challenging for average bikers. The ascent is really long, I would say. It's not a hardcore one – I wasn't exhausted after it, as it's just 200 meters of ascent in the end. But for average biker could be challened with it. 
I would suggest taking a break in Oborniki Śląskie. Check out DeguStacja restaurant, vegan options are available.

However, climbing really pays off. You will get a pleasure of having a delightful, extremely engaging downhill ride to Oborniki Śląskie.

#### Descent to Wrocław

Then from Oborniki Śląskie, you have a delicate downhill, a delicate descent towards Wrocław, mixed with some gravel riding, which makes it a really, really nice outro.

#### The Finish Line

As I mentioned, the last part of the route is made of a mix of bike lines, pedestrian paths and crosswalks alongside a very busy road connecting the city center with the suburbs. The greenery is there, obviously, but as I said, it's rather noisy.

Comparing the end of the route with the beginning - those are two different worlds. The first world is about calmness, nature, and chill, and the second one is about traffic and busyness. But the route ends at home. Have a great riding!
