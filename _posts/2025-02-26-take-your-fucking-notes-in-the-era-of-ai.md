### Take your fucking notes in the era of AI.

And poke with “AI” but does not assume it’s gonna do the job if you can’t.

Most of us, young folks, are aware that in the era of so-called-AI or so-called-Gen-AI everything needs to be automated, are we? Is that what we want?

I doubt that, highly.

I’m writing this from a position of a Software Engineer who, *ugh,* want AI to success. I want us to do crazy, creative stuff with less overhead. No, I don’t mean stakeholder value, I mean we need to grow us humans and finding new ways, solving challenges and making things better is what we have to focus on.

Anyway, if we’re aware that AI does not solve complex challenges nor it’s going to soon enough (or not and I will need to change my mind 🤷‍♂) why are we investing more and more time and money into “AI-based tool”.

I’m doing it for two reasons. The first one is that I’m interested in technology in general and its (often overrated) impact on the society and economy from a long, long time. I also want boring tasks to be done quicker so I can do more relevant work — or spend more time with my family.

The second reason is quite prosaic — I fear that I won’t stand out anymore. I won’t be relevant in the era of aggressive capitalism without embracing my tech-bros-solution to everything = AI tools. And I’m guilty as charged! Currently paying for Windsurf, ChatGPT and Copilot. L O L

Why!?

Back to the topic.

If you realised that people around you stoped taking notes during meetings… ask them why? Is that because automatic AI-based transcription is running in the background? Ask them this: What have you been noting so far, mate? What people said? What’s the role of taking notes?

I stopped taking notes for a brief moment. Now, I’m back to it.

I realised this:

Taking notes is never about what people have said.

Taking notes it’s about building a mental model of the challange the team is facing. Pinpointing crucial knowledge and creating wisdom from it. It’s about uncovering insights and directions by asking the right questions, connecting dots, nailing down assumptions and making space for thoughts and ideas that are important but does not necessary have to be addressed here and now.

I cannot really express how this is different to the AI based transcription happening in the background.

So, please, do take your fucking notes. #okBoomer

Draw manually (on screen too!) and ideate like a human because that will always be a worthy, interesting and fulfilling task to do.

And try out AI tools from time to time. They might help with some of your challenges.
