![Rookie At A Tech Conference? Read this!]({{ '/assets/PXL_20250709_173040702.MP.jpg' | relative_url }})

I had attended a couple of big tech conferences, including We Are Developers three times (15k+ people), a few DroidCons around the world (5k+ people attending) and a few, smaller ones. I think we need to discuss how to survive those.

Meet and talk to people— it will make you feel gooooood. Even, if you're scared initially (I was). Let's make it natural and honest along the way. It's not always easy, not for everyone, but there are couple of steps you can take to make it easier, and what's more important, more natural and meaningful for both parties!

Hang around booths and expo sites for a while and take a part in quizes, games and challenges. Find platform and tools providers you and your team uses and talk to them about your experience, what you like about them and what are you pain points. If you had delivered any rare use case, even if smallest one, talk about it. It's very natural and super effective. You will came up with a topic, for sure, and the good new is that the other side is trying to fine one as well! As a side effect you can get a free advice and even a consultancy session.

Then, find early startups— which could help with your challenges— and request a short demo. Give feedback. Be polite but straightforward. Take your time. They are offering a product— you may offer 10m of your time. They are interested in you, since their goal is to sell. That's sounds like nonsense— shallow relationship you do not care about. Nonsense! 

It's all trade, and the gains are -you will feel good. You got either free gifts, trials, subscription, advice or consultancy of a mixture of all. Companies got data and feedback. Win is a win.

Talks. Yeah, talks. Plan ahead, at least the first day. Ask yourself this: What are my routines during the day? What do I like? What makes me overstimulated, tired or just angry?

Giving you an example. I need to eat a proper breakfast. I need movement in the morning in order to be able to focus during the day. I need second coffee between 10–11am, and my lunch between 12–1:30pm. So I stay happy, sharp, talkative, open, emotionally regulated and honest. Following those and engagement feels effortless. My goal is to return to my family, after those days at the conference, in a good shape emotional and physical state as well. 
So, I need a buffer. Always.

What does it mean again? I need to listen to my needs. You too. Try. 

I cycle to a conference (you can take a walk, hit the gym, whatever). I'm late for a confernce, hitting stages at 9:30am or later. The day will eventually end up at the evening or later. Do not regret being slow at the morning. I prioritise lunch (and coffee/walks breaks)—even if talks are engaging—because I know myself and I know what I need in a long term—I want to be able focus on talks in the afternoon as well—and to be able to attend networking party with cool vibeeee, in example. The entire day is tireing and stop pretending it's not! 

So, I avoid having fomo around tech talks. They are being recorded. Most of them are shitty anyway. Those people attend other conferences. 
They are on the linkedin as well. If the talks is crappy—do not regret getting out of it. Take a break. Talk to people. 
In my personal experince, during the 2 day conference I have a pleasure to listen to between 3 to 6 amazing talks, maybe 2 average ones more. The rest is redundancy, noise or shitty. More senior you got - it's harder to find meaningful content. 

It's very easy to get overwhelmed. Take it easy. Plan breaks ahead and DO NOT attend everything, one by one. And DO NOT run between stages like a crazy dog. It's devastating. Be classy, do not hurry. Plan. 

Side notes. Do attend topics outside of your specialisation. Especially the founders and business people fire chats (avoid consultants!!!)—see how they think— even if you don't agree with it.

Water queues. People usually spend quite a lot of time actually in a water queues on the conferences. Bring your own bottle and save half an hour daily. Seriously. It's ridiculous. 

Use mix gender toilets. I know it sound silly. Those toilets are the emptiest and cleanest of all. You will love that. 

Leave earlier. Recharge before the second, third or fourth day.

Do you know what this attitude brought to me?
I connected with couple poeple, with a goal to talk after the conference. I remember a few, but impactfull ones very well and I know I will apply learnings soon. I have a feeling I got more than before by being the "chill guy". I had a good time, met my goals, returned refreshed. 

Have fun!
