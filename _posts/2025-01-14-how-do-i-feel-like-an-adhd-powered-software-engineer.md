It’s like being a chipset with one processor and one virtual thread. However, you’re forced to run software that requires sophisticated parallel processing. You know you could do better sometimes but you can’t. You day dream about you wasted potential.

It’s like being sure you have a lot of cache memory available but the miss cache event happens too often since your algorithms are quite fucked up. There are heuristics, but they are not always the best. They are better then most, but not always and in random moments.

You know you have a massive L1 and L2 cache size. Your processor runs more efficiently than most people’s processors but just for the shortest period. This leads to overheating quickly.

On the other hand, the L3 cache is not even considered as the source of commands. So, in the end, you forget to do basic stuff. For example, turn on the cooling system (do some rest and emotional reset). Leading to being nearly dead at the end of the day (from overheating) since the deadline triggers alarms instead of planning for the maintenance.

It’s like you know your memory drive cannot store commands (ideas, plans) so you have to process them NOW or NEVER. Then it’s gone.

You’re aware that you cannot process boring stuff for too long. The system would eventually shut down since “boring” stuff makes gooooo “blue screen of death”.

It makes you stuck on tasks that should take seconds for days. And you need someone to help you reset. You need manual, external intervention, at least you feel that way.

You are supposed to!

But do not worry. Attention distraction disorder is a mixture of super-powers which make you an interesting person. But yeah, it’s a super-burden as well. We’re not just happy people with lots of energy.

Be aware of yourself. Be kind. Cut off daily information ingestion. Take care of yourself. Take breaks. Change your habits and follow your dreams when you can. Take a rest, when you need it.  
The world will wait. Even if the entire world is screaming the opposite.

PS

This is my own, a bit satirical opinion on ADHD/ADD. Please do not treat it as guidance, because I’m not an expert and we are all different.
